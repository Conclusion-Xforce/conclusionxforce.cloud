Hi there! I’m Marina, a Monitoring & Observability Consultant working for Conclusion Xforce.

Next to designing, implementing and teaching best-practice observability solutions to our customers, I also enjoy giving technical demos and helping my colleagues with anything observability and monitoring-related. Since November 2024, I am also Technical Coach, meaning I am responsible for the enablement of our colleagues in the field of Observability. 
You can also find me on the [Dynatrace community](https://community.dynatrace.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/2456), where I post my ideas, answer questions and brainstorm with other experts. For me, the Dynatrace community is an excellent way to challenge myself and stay up-to-date. Since November 2024, I can also call myself a Dynatrace Community DynaMight. 

If you want to know more about me or connect, please check out my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marina-pollehn/).
