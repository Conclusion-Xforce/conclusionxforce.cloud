## Frederique

Hi there! I'm Frederique, I work for
[Conclusion Xforce](https://www.conclusionxforce.nl/) as a consultant for AWS
and Kubernetes. I'm also the Technical Coach for our cloud (AWS + Azure) focus
group. I love to share my knowledge via presentations and blogs.

## Presentations

Once a year I'm one of the presenters of a presentation about new developments
in AWS, based on AWS re:Invent. Last year I also presented part of the
presentation about KubeCon 2025 in London.

give, see our [meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/nl-NL/xforce-kennissessies/).
