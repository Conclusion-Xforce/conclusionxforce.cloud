## Frederique

Hi there! I'm Frederique, I work for
[Conclusion Xforce](https://www.conclusionxforce.nl/) as a consultant for AWS
and Kubernetes. I'm also the Technical Coach for our public cloud (AWS + Azure)
focus group. I love to share my knowledge via presentations and blogs.

## Presentations

Once a year I'm one of the presenters of a presentation about new developments
in AWS, based on AWS re:Invent. Last year I also gave a presentation about the
presentations we saw on KubeCon 2025 in London.

For more information about the presentations that Conclusion Xforce is about to
give, see our [meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/nl-NL/xforce-kennissessies/).

## Blogs

I wrote a few blogs on this site already, and there is more to come! Read for
example the blogs about:

* [AWS Nuke with AWS Step Functions](https://conclusionxforce.cloud/blog/aws-nuke-with-aws-stepfunctions/),
* [ArgoCD SSO based on AWS Cognito Userpools](https://conclusionxforce.cloud/blog/argocd-sso-based-on-aws-cognito-userpools/)
* [Azure monitor alerts to Dynatrace](https://conclusionxforce.cloud/blog/azure-alerts-dynatrace/).

In the past I also wrote
[blogs for Conclusion AMIS](https://technology.amis.nl/author/frederique-retsemaamis-nl/).
