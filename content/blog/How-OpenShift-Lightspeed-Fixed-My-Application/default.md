## The Assignment
Recently I started playing with AI a bit but wanted to know how I can really use it in my daily job. So how do I configure OpenShift Lightspeed and actually make use of the promise that it will not only explain what is wrong with my environment but can inform me of the options, check the SLA on the basis of my documentation and actually fix it for me.

## The Prerequisites
To fix this I had to make a couple of choices.
1) What LLM was I going to use. I could go for one of the public available LLMs such as ChatGPT, but to really get the DIY feeling I wanted to run it "locallY' using RHEL AI. Using a bootable image I could start easily without changing anything for my OpenShift lcuster itself (could have use OpenShift AI)
2) I needed an OpenShift Cluster. For this I chose my OpenShift Local node.

# Step 1 - Run the LLM

# Step 2 - Install OpenShift Lightspeed

# Step 3 - Configure RAG

# Step 4 - Configure MCP

# Step 5 - Hands-off: "OpenShift Lightspeed fix my application!"
